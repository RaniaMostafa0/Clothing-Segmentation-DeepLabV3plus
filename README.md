# Clothing-Segmentation-DeepLabV3plus

Semantic segmentation of clothing items from photographs of people, using DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet101 backbone, fine-tuned on a remapped subset of the ATR (Active Template Regression) dataset. Includes training, quantitative evaluation (IoU, pixel accuracy), a standalone inference pipeline, and an interactive Streamlit web app.

## Overview

Semantic segmentation (rather than instance segmentation) was chosen because the task requires per-pixel labeling of clothing on a single person, matching ATR's annotation format. Body-part labels (hair, face, arms, legs) were remapped to background, and left/right shoe were merged into a single `Shoes` class, reducing the label space to 11 task-relevant classes:

`Background, Hat, Sunglasses, Upper-clothes, Skirt, Pants, Dress, Belt, Shoes, Bag, Scarf`

## Architecture

- **Backbone**: ResNet101 (ImageNet/COCO-pretrained), encoding 256×256 input down to a 16×16, 2048-channel feature map.
- **ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling)**: Parallel atrous convolutions at dilation rates 6, 12, 18, capturing multi-scale context without further downsampling.
- **Decoder**: Upsamples ASPP output and fuses it with low-level ResNet features via a skip connection to recover spatial detail.
- **Output head**: Final classifier replaced to predict 11 classes instead of the original 21 COCO classes.
- **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss (standard for multiclass, mutually-exclusive pixel classification).

## Dataset

- **Source**: ATR dataset, loaded via HuggingFace (`mattmdjaga/human_parsing_dataset`), 17,706 image-mask pairs.
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized to 256×256 (bilinear interpolation) and normalized with ImageNet mean/std; masks resized to 256×256 using nearest-neighbor interpolation to preserve discrete class labels.
- **Split**: 80% train (14,166) / 10% val (1,770) / 10% test (1,770), fixed seed for reproducibility.
- **Augmentation** (training only): random horizontal flip (50%), random brightness adjustment ±20% (50%).

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean IoU (test set) | **0.601** |
| Pixel Accuracy (test set) | **0.961** |
| Training epochs | 15 |
| Best checkpoint | Epoch 8 (val loss 0.1185) |
| Hardware | NVIDIA RTX 2080 |
| Optimizer | Adam, lr 1e-4, batch size 8 |

The gap between pixel accuracy (96.1%) and mean IoU (60.1%) reflects class imbalance — Background alone covers most pixels (0.975 IoU), inflating pixel accuracy independently of smaller-class performance.

### Per-Class IoU (test set)

| Class | IoU |
|---|---|
| Background | 0.975 |
| Pants | 0.767 |
| Upper-clothes | 0.762 |
| Bag | 0.653 |
| Skirt | 0.634 |
| Shoes | 0.622 |
| Hat | 0.608 |
| Dress | 0.611 |
| Scarf | 0.372 |
| Sunglasses | 0.379 |
| Belt | 0.222 |

Large, frequent classes segment well; small/infrequent accessories (Belt, Sunglasses, Scarf) underperform due to limited pixel footprint and lower training representation.

## Real-World Testing

The model was additionally tested on 45 personal photographs beyond the ATR test set to assess generalization:

- **Strengths**: Reliable segmentation of large clothing categories (Dress, Upper-clothes, Pants); correctly handles multi-person images when subjects are clearly separated.
- **Limitations**: 
  - Small accessory classes (Belt, Sunglasses, Scarf) frequently misclassified.
  - Clothing missed/misclassified when the subject occupies a small fraction of the frame.
  - Segmentation degrades with 4-6+ people in frame which is expected, since the ATR training dataset consists exclusively of single-person images; the model was never exposed to multi-subject scenes during training.
  - Occasional misclassification on unusual camera angles (e.g. overhead shots).

## Future Work

- Combined CrossEntropy + Dice loss to improve performance on underrepresented classes.
- Training at higher resolution to recover finer boundary detail.
- Expanded training data for multi-person scenes.
